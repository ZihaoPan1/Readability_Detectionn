W: David, how was your holiday?

M: Great, I climbed Mount Fuji. It was really beautiful. Now I can check one more thing off my list.

W: Your list?

M: Yes. When I was 12, I made a list of things I wanted to do some day.

W: That's interesting. How many of the things on your list have you done so far?

M: Almost half. I have pictures. Would you like to see them?

W: Yes, sure.

M: Here I am on top of Mount Fuji. And here I am in a hot air balloon.

W: When did you do that? I've always wanted to go up in a hot air balloon.

M: It was two years ago, in August, in California.

W: What are your plans for the next holiday?

M: I'm thinking of deep-sea diving in Australia. Do you have any other suggestions?

W: You really ought to take a boat down the Amazon. You'll see a lot of interesting animals and beautiful trees. It's one of the best places I've been to.

M: OK. I'll put it on my list.
